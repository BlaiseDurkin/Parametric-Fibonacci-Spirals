spiral.py creates animations using golden ratio spirals.

Step 1. Install graphics package.

In spiral.py:
main() draws several spirals which spiral into the center.
main_2() draws 6 spirals in a star shape.

In order to take a picture, uncomment the calls to the takepic() function.
In order to make a gif with the pictures, run the relevant blocks of code in manager.py.

manager.py makes new directory, deletes files, groups picture files, converts .eps to .png, and makes .gif file using sequence of .png's using the moviepy.editor library. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INSTALLED ALL THE RELEVANT PACKAGES.
